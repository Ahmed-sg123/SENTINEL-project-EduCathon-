# SENTINEL-project-EduCathon-
**the project that will change people's lives in the future**
## Quote of the day
***When you are out of time, drink coffee***- Ahmed yasser(me)
## How to use

1. Download the python file and creds.txt
2. make sure the creds.txt is an empty txt file. so that it can work properly.
3. make sure to download the needed libraries. such as art,os,time,re and haslib.
4. run the code in Visual Studio Code for the best experience and open the terminal window
5. now the program should be ready and good to go

this project is a python only project, so it lacks the streangth of design and the UI.
However, good ideas are not by design(most of the time).

please note that the libraries should be downloaded using the pip command in the terminal. so that the libraries can run without any concerns.
please note that this is a cli project.I had no time to create a UI for this project.
## Features

1. this project is a cli project.
2. this project is a python only project.

## database

 **creds.txt**
 make sure to have this file. its case sensitive and it should be empty. otherwise the code would have a problem functioning properly in the login process.
